## Introduction

If you have heard of machine learning before, chances are you have heard of
neural networks as well. Neural networks are often called **artificial
neural networks** because their structure is loosely modeled off of the structure of the brain.
The human brain contains around 100 billion
neurons. Each neuron is a small cell that transmits signals, and is connected
to other neurons via their synapses. These small
neuron units and their connections when linked together give humans the
capability to think.


A similar approach was taken in developing artificial neural networks.
In an artificial neural network, many units (artificial neurons)
function together to give the system the capability
to learn from data. Like the brain, these neurons are connected to each other. The
exact structure of neural networks and how these connections and neurons work
will be discussed in the following pages.


So why are neural networks so popular?  In recent years, neural networks have
exploded in popularity.  Cheaper and more powerful hardware has allowed researchers
to link together thousands, and even millions, of artificial neurons into artificial neural networks,
allowing for a more powerful extension of machine learning called **deep learning**.
This renaissance in deep learning has seen countless breakthroughs in neural networks
and their applications. The second reason is the versatility of neural
networks. With their highly flexible architecture, neural networks have found applications
in text, speech, images and much more. They have proven to be a useful machine learning
tool in a variety of situations.

For better or for worse, there is a good amount of math associated with neural networks. This post
will discuss much of the surface level theory that goes into a neural
network. From this theory, you should gain a good understanding of how basic
neural networks work, which will then allow you to work on actual implementations.

**Note**: Since the material in this lesson may be more challenging than in previous lesson, we have included both video links and written content. We recommend that you go through all the content in order (including videos and text), since reading through the written explanations may further reinforce your understanding of the content presented in the videos. As usual, take your time if necessary, since some of these ideas make take a few read-throughs to really sink in.


## Intro to Deep Learning

Before we delve too deep into the theory behind neural networks, it may help to see how neural networks, which are the key enabler of deep learning, relate to linear and logistic regression (which are examples of traditional machine learning). This 11-minute video should give you a good idea of why neural networks are a more flexible tool than simple linear regression, and what the connections between neurons in neural networks are actually doing. Lucky for us, the speaker even explains these ideas in terms of the housing price prediction problem that we discussed earlier.

<p style="text-align:center">

</p>

**Recap**: In order to make truly accurate housing price predictions, we may need more information than just the inputs given to us in their current form (e.g. number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc). In many instances, *combinations* of these features (e.g. 2 bedrooms **and** 2 bathrooms) can be just as important as the original features to the final price. While pure linear regression won't let us take this into account, neural networks will. Neural networks work by combining *layers* of neurons, which allows the network to learn these relevant combinations of features and use them to generate more accurate predictions. After the input layer, each successive layer of neurons learns to detect some increasingly abstract combinations of features from the previous layer, until we finally use these learned compound-features to make a final prediction.

This layering of features may not seem too groundbreaking right now, but you'll eventually see how this concept of learning more and more abstract combinations of features will allow us to build up representations of much more complex types of data, such as images, text, etc.


## Neural Network Architecture

In order to see how the actual math behind neural networks work, let's look at
another example problem. This time, let's try to predict test scores based on
two input features: hours studied and hours slept. Along the way, you'll see
how the layers of neurons in neural networks can use a series of mathematical
operations to transform some input data and use it to make a final prediction.
The following video will provide a high level overview of what neural networks
are all about when trying to solve our test scores problem. We will go more in
depth on these terms in the next couple of sections.

<p style="text-align:center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bxe2T-V8XRs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

**Recap:** At a completely abstract level, what a neural network is doing is
taking in some inputs $$X$$ (e.g. hours studied and hours slept), applying some
transormations, and then generating an outputted prediction $$y$$ (e.g. test
score). (The part about scaling/normalizing the input data is an example of
input preprocessing, and is used to make the inputs "work" with the model; don't
worry too much about it for now, as it's not important for our understanding of
neural networks to start.) 

Between the input and output layers, we also have
some hidden layers made up of neurons. Each neuron takes in the output from the
previous layer, scales each piece of input data by some weights (much like in
linear/logistic regression), sums up over these weighted inputs, and then
applies an activation function. This final activation then gets passed to the
neurons of the next layer as a new series of inputs. The next couple of
sections will get into what exactly it is that the neuron does.

### Networks

What is a neural network? Let's begin by dissecting the name itself.
In mathematics, a network can be thought of as a graph, and is nothing more than a set of
vertices or *nodes* that are connected via arrows, or *edges*. They can be used to represent
everything from connections within friend groups (mathematical "social networks") to
connections between artificial neurons. In our neural network the nodes and
edges will have special meanings.
An example of a network is shown here.

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/directed_acyclic_graph.png' />

The other important aspect of our neural network is, of course, the "neuron." We
want our network to be able to understand and learn. While this might seem
difficult at first, we will see that neural networks use these graphs as a powerful
structure to define operations to learn desired responses. The building block
of these networks is the neuron.

### The Neuron

Before we talk about full neural networks, let's examine
an individual artificial neuron. An illustration of an artificial neuron is shown below.

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/single-neuron.png' width="40%"/>

Before we get into the actual intuition of what a neuron is, let's get
through the math behind one, since the artificial neuron is at its core a mathematical construct.

<p>
    The input of the incoming edge is notated as the scalar \( p \). (The videos above used \( x \) instead to represent the inputs -- same idea, just different notation.) This edge has
    a weight of the scalar \( w \). The weight is multiplied by the input to form the value
    \( wp \). This is then sent into the the summation block, which sums the
    input \( wp \) and the bias \( b \). Notice that the bias has no
    dependence on the input. Summing these two terms together then
    gives the weighted sum \( wp + b \), which we will represent as \( n \).
</p>

<p>
    The output of the summation \( n \) is then passed through the activation
    function \( f \). The activation function is just some real valued scalar
    function that we use to squash our output to within a desired range.
    This then gives the final output of the neuron,
    \( f(n) = a \). The neuron output can then be calculated as:
    $$ a = f(wp + b) $$
</p>

### <a name="neuron_intuition"></a>Neuron Intuition

<p>
  So what is the intuition behind a neuron? We can view the output of this
  neuron as making a <i>decision</i>.  This decision is based on the
  inputs, weights and bias of the neuron. Suppose you are trying to make the
  decision of if you want to go to a party tonight. Let's say we live in a
  world where this decision depends on only two factors: 1. if you are tired (\( x_0 \)), and
  2. if your best friend at the party (\(x_1\)).
  Note that these factors are simple yes or no
  questions. We can <i>encode</i> a yes as \( 1 \) and a no as \( 0 \).
</p>

<p>
  The importance of these two factors will vary a lot from person to person.
  This corresponds to different weight values. For this neuron, say that our
  activation function is the simple linear function \( f(x) = x \), and
  that any output \( > 0 \) means we should decide to go to the party and any
  output \( < 0 \) means that we should decide to not go. A normal person would
  not want to go to a party while tired. We should then make the weight (\(w_0
  \)) for the "are you tired" input (\( x_0 \)) negative. On the other hand, you would
  hopefully want to go if your best friend going, so the corresponding weight (\(w_1\))
  for that input (\(x_1\)) would be positive.
</p>

<p>
  Say that you absolutely hate going out when you are tired and this is far
  more important than your best friend being at the party. We could make \(
  w_0 = -10 \) and \( w_1 = 1 \) to represent this. If you  are tired, you will
  never go out even if your best friend is there, because \( -10 + 1 < 0 \). However, if
  your best friend is there but you are not tired, you would still go out, because \( 0 +
  1 > 0 \). If you were not tired and your best friend wasn't there, you would
  be right on the decision boundary and could just choose randomly.
</p>

<p>
  Now that we have an idea of a decision boundary set up,
  we can now incorporate <i>bias</i> to change our decision boundary. When we had no
  bias in the previous example, the decision boundary (or cutoff) was 0.
  If someone is more or less inclined to go to parties no matter what the inputs are,
  we can account for this by adding on a bias term \( b \) to the weighted sum \( w_0x_0 + w_1x_1 \),
  thereby shifting the decision boundary.
  A more positive bias means that we are more inclined to go to parties given any inputs.
</p>

<p>
  To demonstrate, let's
  change the problem slightly by making \( x_1 \) the <i>number</i> of your friends
  that are going. If you generally enjoy going to parties, your decision neuron
  could have \( b = 2 \), and of course you do do not like going to a party while tired
  but would be more inclined to go if you had more friends there, so \( w_0 = -4, w_1 = 1 \). So even
  if you are tired, it would only take three of your friends to be there for you
  to want to go to the party (\( (-4*1) + (1*3) + 2 = 1 \)). But if \( b = 0 \), it would take five friends if
  you are tired (\( (-4*1) + (1*5) + 0 = 1 \)).
</p>

### <a name="activation-functions"></a>Activation Functions

<p>
  In our example, we chose the linear activation function, where our equation took
  the form \( a = w_0 x_0 + w_1 x_1 + b \). This means that our output activation \( a \)
  could be any real number, positive or negative.
  Our simple linear linear activation function would look like the
  below for input \( p \) and output \( a \).
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/pure-linear-transform.png' />

<p>
  However, there are a variety of other activation functions that are employed
  in neurons giving different ranges of responses.
</p>

<p>
  Going back to the decision about the party, say there is another person that
  is trying to <i>predict</i> if you are going to go to the party. In this
  case, we would want our output to be a **probability** (between 0-1), so our
  earlier cut-off rule will not apply. We could just take the pure score value,
  and based on how positive or negative it is, determine how certain you are to
  go to the party. However, there is a function called the <i>sigmoid</i>
  function that does a better job of representing these probabilistic outputs.
  Any probability can be represented between 0 and 1.  The sigmoid function
  does just this, by squashing any real value to fit between 0 and 1.  Below is
  an image of the sigmoid function in action.
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/sigmoid.png' />

<p>
  After applying the sigmoid function, very negative values (which, using our previous cutoff rule, would make us not want to go to the party) will produce values close to 0; very positive
  values (which would make us want to go to the party) will produce outputs close to 1.
</p>

<p>
  Neural networks are probabilistic systems, and therefore functions like the
  sigmoid function are a lot more powerful than just the linear activation
  function. We will see why the sigmoid function and other non-linear functions
  are so powerful in later lessons.
</p>



### Forward Propagation

Now, let's start chaining multiple of these neurons together and start
formalizing and abstracting the math behind the networks. Watch the following
video for some intuition on how the complete process of stacking layers of
neurons on each other works. **Forward propagation** simply refers to the process
of *propagating* an input through all the neural network layers in order
to evaluate the final output.

<p style="text-align:center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJwK6jAStmg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

**Recap:** Before training the model, we must decide on some hyperparameters for our model: these include values like the number of hidden layers in our network, how many neurons will be in each hidden layer, etc. The actual automated learning process takes place in the weights of the network, which are similar to the model weights that we saw in linear/logistic regression.
We can perform the data transformations described above by placing these weights in a matrix, and then multiplying the input matrix by this weight matrix. The result is then fed through our activation function to squash the values to within our desired range, finally giving us the outputs of the hidden layer. To get from our hidden layer to our final prediction, we once again multiply the outputs of the hidden layer by our last weight matrix and apply our activation, giving us a final prediction that lies within our desired range.

**Notes:**
* This process is called "Forward Propagation" because we start with our input data $$X$$ and propagate it forward through the layers of our network, applying matrix multiplications and activation functions until we end up with our final result, $$\hat{y}$$.
* Since we started with random weights and haven't yet trained our network, this neural network is still pretty much useless in generating meaningful outputs. In the next lesson, we'll see how we can train a neural network so that it can start to have meaningful outputs.

*Sneak preview:* once again, we'll be measuring the error of our network using a cost function, and applying our good friend gradient descent on the weights of our neural network to minimize this cost function. The goal is that after optimizing our model weights, propagating our inputs (e.g. hours slept, hours studied) forward through the network will cause the input data to become transformed in such a way that the network outputs a reasonable final result (e.g. predicted test score).

### Vector Formulation

<p>
  Before moving on, let's clean up some of the math behind what we have
  developed with the neuron so far. Say we have the multiple input neuron
  pictured below.
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/multiple_input_neuron.png' width="40%"/>

<p>
  Each of the inputs to the node can just be represented as a vector to make
  the representation easier.
  $$ \textbf{p} = \begin{bmatrix}
                    p_1 \\
                    p_2 \\
                    p_3 \\
                    \vdots \\
                    p_R
                  \end{bmatrix}$$
  (We'll use bold face to represent vectors.)

</p>
<p>
  Likewise, we can also formulate the list of weights for each input value as a
  vector.
  $$
  \textbf{w}_1 =  \begin{bmatrix}
                    w_{1,1},
                    w_{1,2},
                    w_{1,3} ,
                    \dots
                    w_{1, R}
                  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
  The first subscripted number represents the neuron number (which is 1 because we only have 1 neuron),
  and the second subscripted number represents which input the weight corresponds to.
  Note that the weight vector is a row vector (not a column vector);
  due to the way matrix/vector multiplication works,
  this will become necessary for when we will have to multiply this weight vector with the input vector.
</p>

<p>
  Just as before, we are simply multiplying the inputs by their corresponding weights. So our next
  step would be just to multiply each input in the input vector
  by the corresponding weight in the weight vector.
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
    w_{1,1} p_1,
    w_{1,2} p_2,
    w_{1,3} p_3,
    \dots
    w_{1,R} p_R
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
</p>

<p>
  The next step is to go through the summation. Summing up the components of this
  vector gives
  $$ w_{1,1} p_1 + w_{1,2} p_2 + w_{1,3} p_3 + \dots + w_{1, R} p_R $$
</p>
<p>
  This is the same as just multiplying the two vectors \( \textbf{w}_1 \textbf{p}\).
  Then we add in the bias \(b\), which, as before, is just a single scalar.
  $$ n = w_{1,1} p_1 + w_{1,2} p_2 + w_{1,3} p_3 + \dots + w_{1, R} p_R + b =
  \textbf{w}_1 \textbf{p} + b$$
</p>

<p>
  Note that this entire expression \(n=\textbf{w}_1 \textbf{p}+b\),
  which represents the weighted sum of all the neuron's inputs (including a bias),
  is still just a scalar. 
  (In the video, this scalar was represented as \(\textbf{z}\).)
  This is because \(\textbf{w}_1\) is a \(1 \times R \) matrix, while \(
  \textbf{p} \) is a \( R \times 1 \) matrix, resulting in a \( 1 \times 1\)
  matrix. We then squash this weighted sum using the activation function to
  get the final output of the node.  $$ a = f(\textbf{w}_1 \textbf{p} + b )$$
</p>

This one equation pretty much sums up everything that a single artificial neuron does: multiplying the neuron's inputs by their corresponding weights, summing up these weighted inputs (along with a bias term), and then applying an activation function at the end to squash the output to within a desired range.

The next step is to see what happens once we start working with multiple neurons, which we can combine vertically to form layers. We will first look at the case where we have just one layer of neurons.

### Layers of Neurons

<p>
  We know that the weights of a neuron control how a decision is made by the
  neuron. Different weights will give a neuron different decision properties.
  What if we wanted to work with multiple neurons, each with different weights
  at the same time? In this case, each neuron can thought of as making some different decision
  based on the same inputs (e.g. whether to go to the party, what to bring to the party, etc.).
  We could do this by stacking the neurons into a
  <i>layer</i> of neurons, where the inputs are fed into each neuron in
  parallel.
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/neuron_layer.png' width="30%"/>

Now, the same principle applies as before: only now that we have multiple neurons, each neuron will have its own weight vector $$w_i$$. Each neuron will use its own weights to generate a different output $$a_i$$ .

<p>
  For neuron \(i\), calculate the output
  \(a_i\) through the following formula. Note that we are assuming that all of
  the neurons are using the same activation function, which is a safe
  assumption to make for this case.
  $$ a_i = f(\textbf{w}_i \textbf{p} + b) $$
  However, we can compact this further, and view the weights as a matrix of weights
  represented as follows. Let's say that there are \(S\) neurons (or nodes) that the input is being fed
  into. Each row in the matrix represents all the weights for one given neuron.
  Each column represents the weights used by different neurons for one given input feature.
  $$ \textbf{W} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    w_{1,1} & w_{1,2} & w_{1,3} & \dots & w_{1,R} \\
    w_{2,1} & w_{2,2} & w_{2,3} & \dots & w_{2,R} \\
    w_{3,1} & w_{3,2} & w_{3,3} & \dots & w_{3,R} \\
    \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
    w_{S,1} & w_{S,2} & w_{S,3} & \dots & w_{S,R} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \textbf{w}_1 \\
    \textbf{w}_2 \\
    \textbf{w}_3 \\
    \vdots \\
    \textbf{w}_S \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
  When we multiply this weight matrix by the input vector (\(\textbf{Wp}\)), we will get a vector
  representing the weighted sums for each neuron in this layer.
</p>

<p>
  Next, since there are now multiple neurons each making different decisions,
  we will have one bias term for each of our \(S\) neurons. We can represent these with
  a bias vector (\(\textbf{b}\)), which will then be added on to our vector of weighted sums.
  $$
  \textbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
  b_1,
  b_2,
  b_3,
  \dots
  b_S
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
</p>

<p>
  Finally, we can get our vector of outputs (or activations) \(\textbf{a}\) by
  passing each value of the vector through the activation function.
  $$ \textbf{a} = f(\textbf{W} \textbf{p} + \textbf{b})$$
  This then gives us a vector representing the final outputs for each neuron in the layer.
</p>

### Multiple Layers

<p>
  What happens if we feed the outputs of one layer of neurons into another
  layer of neurons?
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/multiple_layers.png' width="60%"/>

<p>
  This is where we begin to see the power of neural networks. Each layer of
  neruon works on the abstraction of the previous layer. This allows deeper
  layers to make more complex and higher level decisions. Let's take a concrete
  example. Say you were builidng a neural network that takes as input
  handwritten images. The first layer could detect edges. The second could
  identify the contour the edges form. The third could take these contours and
  identify them with shapes. The fourth and final could take these shapes and
  associate them with numbers.
</p>

<p>
  Now, notate the weight matrix for layer \(i\) to be \(\textbf{W}^{i}\), and the
  corresponding bias vector for layer layer \(i\) to be \(\textbf{b}^{i}\). Note
  that the number of neurons in each layer can differ.
  The neurons in any given layer are connected to <i>all</i> of the neurons
  in the neighboring layers, so the exact number of neurons in the neighboring
  layers doesn't really matter. The
  example below is a little more concrete of such a network.
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/network_example.png' width="60%"/>

<p>
  We can simply use the rules used to compute the output of one layer and
  extend it to multiple layers. In this case,
  the output of one layer will be fed in as the input to the next layer, resulting
  in a composition of functions that sort of resembles a sandwich when written out completely.
  For instance, to compute the output of the above
  3-layer network, would evaluate the following equation.
  $$
  \textbf{a}^3 = f^3 ( \textbf{W}^3 f^2 ( \textbf{W}^2 f^1 (\textbf{W}^1
  \textbf{p} + \textbf{b}^1) + \textbf{b}^2) + \textbf{b}^3 )
  $$
  Notice how the input \(p\) is propagated from the left of the network to the
  right of the network.
</p>

<p>
  Typically, you will see neural networks illustrated in the less expressive
  version shown below to save space. In this illustration, each node simply
  represents one neuron.
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/nn_illustration.png' />

### Training a One-Layer Network

To see how we can train simple one-layer neural networks to make more accurate
predictions, see our supplementary write-up here: [**Lesson 4 Supplemental
Material**](/blog/curriculum-supplement/lesson4supplement). This lesson is not
essential for the high level understanding of neural networks but goes
into the math of optimization and could be useful for becoming more familiar
with the math used in deep learning.

### Conclusion

<p>
  That is all for the basics of a neural network building blocks. You should be
  able to see how a neural network produces an output for some input. But what
  are all these transformations doing? The key is choosing the right values for
  the weights and the biases to make the network do interesting things. We can
  do this through having the network <b>learn</b> the weights and biases.
</p>

<p>
  We simply tell the neural network to learn, for some datset \(X,
  Y\), the mapping from \( X \) to \( Y \), and the network will find the
  appropriate weights to do so. To go back to our party example,
  we would feed the network a bunch of examples of times you have decided to go (or not to go)
  to parties, along with the the inputs from each instance
  (were you tired or not, how many of your friends were there), and the network
  would be able to learn the correct weights so that it could predict if you
  would want to go to a certain party or not given some new inputs.
</p>

<p>
  When it comes down to it, the neural network is still a statistical learner:
  given a set of input data \(X\)
  and a set of output data \( Y \), a neural network can learn a reasonable mapping from
  \( X \) to \( Y \). Thanks to the power of deep learning,
  it just so happens that the mappings neural networks generate
  can be much more powerful than those generated by linear or logistic regression.
