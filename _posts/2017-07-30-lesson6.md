In this section, we'll take care of a few loose ends that we may have skimmed
over in the previous lessons. These topics will become especially relevant
for when you try to implement neural networks in your own projects.
Be sure to go through Lessons 4 and 5 before continuing on to this lesson!

<h2><a name="loss"></a>Loss Functions</h2>

<p>
  In our equations of backpropagation, we have used a generalized loss function \( J
  \). This cost function is what we aim to through stochastic
  gradient descent (SGD) and tells us how well the model is doing given the model
  parameters.
</p>

<p>
  In earlier lessons, we saw the mean squared error used as a loss function.
  However, the mean squared
  error may not always be the best cost function to use. In fact, a more popular loss
  function is the <i>cross entropy cost function.</i> Before we get
  more into the cross-entropy cost function, let's look into the <i>softmax
  classification function</i>.
</p>

<h3><a name="softmax"></a>Softmax Classifier</h3>

<p>
  Let's say you are building a neural network to classify between two classes.
  Our neural network will look something like the following image. Notice
  that there are two outputs \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) representing class one and
  two respectively.
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/decision_network.png' />

<p>
  We are given a set of data points \( \textbf{X} \) and their corresponding
  labels \( \textbf{Y} \). How might we represent the labels? A given point is
  either class one or class two. The boundary is distinct. If you remember the
  linear classification boundary from earlier we said that any output greater
  than 0 was class one and any output less than 0 was class two. However, that
  does not really work here. A given data point \( \textbf{x}_i \) is simply
  class one or class two. We should not have data points be more class one than
  other data points.
</p>

<p>
  We will use <i>one hot encoding</i> to provide labels for these points. If a
  data point has the label of class one simply assign it the label vector \(
  \textbf{y}_i =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    0
  \end{bmatrix} \) and for a data point of class two assign it the label vector
  \( \textbf{y}_i = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    1
  \end{bmatrix} \)
</p>

<p>
  Say our network outputs the value \( \begin{bmatrix}
    c_1 \\
    c_2
  \end{bmatrix} \) where \(c_1, c_2 \) are just constants. We can say the
  network classified the input as class one if \( c_1 > c_2 \) or classified as
  class two if \( c_2 > c_1 \). Let's use the softmax function to interpret
  these results in a more probabilistic manner.
</p>

<p>
  The softmax function is defined as the following
  $$
    q(\textbf{c}) = \frac{e^{c_i}}{\sum_j e^{c_j}}
  $$

  Where \( c_i \) is the scalar output of the \(ith\) element of the output
  vector. Think of the numerator as converting the output to an un-normalized
  probability. Think of the denominator as normalizing the probability. This
  means that for every output \( i \) the loss function will have an output
  between 0 and 1. Another convenient property of the softmax function is that
  the sum of all the output probabilties \( i \) will sum to \( 1 \),
  making this activation function more suitable to working with probability distributions.
</p>

<h3>Entropy</h3>

<p>
  We need to take one more step before we can use the softmax function as a loss function. This
  requires some knowledge of what <i>entropy</i> is. Think about this example. Say you
  were having a meal at EVK, one of the USC dining halls. If your meal is bad,
  this event does not carry much new information, as the meals are almost guaranteed
  to be bad at EVK. However, if the meal is good, this event carries a lot of
  information, since it is out of the ordinary. You would not tell anyone about the bad meal
  (since a bad meal is pretty much expected), but you would tell everyone about the good meal.
  Entropy deals with this measure of information. If we know an underlying
  distribution \( y \) to some
  system, we can define how much information is encoded in each event. We can
  write this mathematically as:
  $$
    H(y) = \sum_i y_i \log \left( \frac{1}{y_i} \right) = - \sum_i y_i \log (
    y_i )
  $$
</p>

<h3>Cross Entropy</h3>

<p>
  This definition assumes that we are operating under the correct underlying
  probability distribution. Let's say a new student at USC has no idea what the
  dining hall food is like and thinks EVK normally serves great food. This
  freshman has not been around long enough to know the true probability
  distribution of EVK food, and instead assumes the probability
  distribution \( y'_i \). Now, this freshman incorrectly
  thinks that bad meals are uncommon. If the freshman were to tell a
  sophomore (who knows the real distribution) that his meal at EVK was
  bad, this information would mean little to the sophomore because the
  sophomore already knows that EVK food is almost always bad. We can say that the cross
  entropy is the encoding of events in \( y \) using the wrong probability
  distribution \( y' \). This gives
  $$
  H(y, y') = - \sum_i y_i \log y'_i
  $$
</p>

<p>
  Now let's go back to our neural network classification problem. We know the
  true probability distribution for any sample should be just the one hot
  encoded label of the sample. We also know that our generated probability
  distribution is the softmax function. This gives the final form of our cross
  entropy loss.
  $$
  L_i = -\log \left( \frac{e^{c_i}}{\sum_j e^{c_j}} \right)
  $$
  Where \( y_i = 1 \) for the correct label and \( y' \) is the softmax
  function.
  This loss function is often called the categorical cross entropy loss
  function because it works with categorical data (i.e. data that can be
  classified into distinct classes).
</p>

<p>
  And while we will not go over it here, know that this function has calculable
  derivatives as well. This allows it to be used just the same as the mean
  squared error loss function. However, the cross
  entropy loss function has many desirable properties that the mean squared
  error does not have when it comes to classification.
</p>

<p>
  Let's say you are trying to predict the classes cat or dog. Your neural
  network has a softmax function on the output layer (as it should because this
  is a classification problem). Let's say for two inputs \(
  \textbf{x}_1,\textbf{x}_2 \) the network respectively outputs
  $$
  \textbf{a}_1 =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0.55 \\
    0.45
  \end{bmatrix},
  \textbf{a}_2 =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0.44 \\
    0.56
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
  where the corresponding labels are
  $$
  \textbf{y}_1 =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    0
  \end{bmatrix},
  \textbf{y}_2 =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    1
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  As you can see, the network only barely classified each result as correct. But
  by only looking at the classification error, the accuracy would have been
  100%.
</p>

<p>
  Take a similar example where the output of the network is just slightly off.
  $$
  \textbf{a}_1 =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0.51 \\
    0.49
  \end{bmatrix},
  \textbf{a}_2 =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0.41 \\
    0.59
  \end{bmatrix},
  \textbf{y}_1 =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    1
  \end{bmatrix},
  \textbf{y}_2 =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    0
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  Now in this case, we would have a 0% classification accuracy.
</p>

<p>
  Let's see what our cross entropy function would have given us in each
  situation when averaged across the two samples.

  In the first situation:
  $$
  -(\log(0.55) + \log(0.56)) / 2 = 0.59
  $$

  In the second situation:
  $$
  -(\log(0.49) + \log(0.59)) / 2 = 0.62
  $$

  Clearly, this result makes a lot more sense for our situation than just
  having a cost value of \( 0 \) for a barely-correct classification.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, the choice of the correct loss function is dependent on the problem, and is a
  decision you must make in designing your neural network. Always keep
  in mind the general equations for stochastic gradient descent will have the form:
  $$
  \mathbf{W} (k) = \textbf{W}(k-1) - \alpha \nabla J(\textbf{x}_k, \textbf{W}(k-1))
  $$
  $$
  \mathbf{b} (k) = \textbf{b}(k-1) - \alpha \nabla J(\textbf{x}_k, \textbf{b}(k-1))
  $$
  Where \( J \) is the loss function. Furthermore, the same form of
  backpropagation equations will still apply with backpropagating the
  error terms through the network.
</p>

<h2><a name="opt"></a>Optimization In Practice (Continued)</h2>

<h3>Mini-batch Algorithm</h3>

<p>
  First let's review our SGD algorithm shown below. Note that \( \theta \) is
  commonly used to refer to all the parameters of our network (including weights and biases).
  $$
  \mathbf{\theta} (k) = \mathbf{\theta}(k-1) - \alpha \nabla J(\textbf{x}_k,
  \mathbf{\theta}(k-1))
  $$
  As this algorithm is <i>stochastic</i> gradient descent, it operates on one input
  example at a time. This is also referred to as online training. However, this
  is not an accurate representation of the gradient, as it is only over a single
  training input, and is not necessarily reflective of the gradient over the
  entire input space. A more accurate representation of the gradient could be
  given by the following.
  $$
  \mathbf{\theta} (k) = \mathbf{\theta}(k-1) - \alpha \nabla J(\textbf{x},
  \mathbf{\theta}(k-1))
  $$
  The gradient at each iteration is now being computed across the entire input
  space. This is referred to as <i>batch gradient descent</i>, which
  actually turns out to be a kind of confusing name in practice (as we'll see in a bit).
</p>

<p>
  In practice, neither of these approaches are desirable. The first does not
  give a good enough of an approximation of the gradient -- the second is
  computationally infeasible, since for each iteration, the gradient of the cost
  function for the entire dataset has to be computed. <b>Mini-batch</b> methods
  are the solution to this problem.
</p>

<p>
  In mini-batch training, a sample set of all the training examples are used to compute the cost
  gradient. The average of these gradients for each sample is then used. This
  approach offers a good trade off between speed and accuracy. The equation
  for this method is given below, where \( Q \) is the number of samples in the
  mini-batch and \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.
  $$
  \mathbf{\theta} (k) = \mathbf{\theta}(k-1) - \frac{\alpha}{Q} \sum_{q=1}^{Q}\nabla
  J(\textbf{x}_q, \mathbf{\theta}(k-1))
  $$
  Remember that batch gradient descent is over the whole input space, while
  mini-batch is just over a smaller subset at a time.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, it would make sense that the samples have to be randomly drawn from
  the input space, as sequential samples will likely have some correlation. The
  typical mini-batch sampling procedure is to randomly shuffle the input space, and then
  to sample sequentially from the scrambled inputs.
</p>

<h3>Initializations</h3>

<p>
  At this point, you may be wondering how the parameters of a neural network are typically
  initialized. So far, the learning procedure has been described, but the actual initial
  state of the network has not been discussed.
</p>

<p>
  You may think that how a network is initialized does not necessarily matter.
  After all, the network should eventually converge to the correct parameters
  right? Unfortunately, this is not the case with neural networks; as it turns out, the
  initialization of the parameters matters greatly. Initializing to small random weights
  typically works. But typically, the standard for weight initialization is
  the normalized initialization method.
</p>

<p>
  In the normalized initialization method, weights are randomly drawn from the following uniform
  distribution:
  $$
  \textbf{W} \sim U \left( -\frac{6}{\sqrt{m+n}}, \frac{6}{m+n} \right)
  $$
  Where \( m \) is the number of inputs into the layer and \( n \) is the
  number of outputs from the layer.
</p>

<p>
  As for the biases, typically just assigning them to a value of 0 works.
</p>

<h3>Challenges in Optimization</h3>

<p>
  In mathematical optimization, we optimize (i.e. find the minimum/maximum of)
  some function \( f \). In machine learning, we can think of training a neural network
  as a specific type of optimization (gradient descent) applied to a specific cost function.
</p>

<p>
  As you may have expected, there are some concerns that can arise in this training phase:
  for example, local minima. Any deep neural network is guaranteed to
  have a very large number of local minima. Take a look at the below
  surface. This surface has two minima: one local, and one global. If you look at
  the contour map below, you can see that the algorithm converges to the local
  minimum instead of the global minimum.
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/optimization_surface_minima.png' />

<p>

  Should we take measures to stop our neural network from converging
  at a local (rather than a global) minimum?
  Local minima would be a concern if the
  cost function evaluated at the local minima was far greater than the cost
  function evaluated at the global minima. It turns out that in practice,
  this difference is often
  negligible. Most of the time, simply finding any minima is sufficient in the
  case of deep neural networks.
</p>

<p>
  Some other potential problem points are saddle points, plateaus, and valleys. In practice, neural
  networks can often escape valleys or saddle points. However, they can still pose a
  serious threat to neural networks, since they can have cost values much
  greater than at the global minimum. Even more dangerous to the training
  process are flat regions on the cost surface. Small initial
  weights are chosen in part to avoid these flat regions.
</p>

<p>
  In general, more flat areas are problematic for the rate of convergence. It
  takes a lot of iterations for the gradient descent algorithm to get over flatter regions.
  One's first thought may be to increase the learning rate of the algorithm, but
  too high of a learning rate will result in divergence at steeper areas of the
  performance surface. When this algorithm with a high learning rate goes
  across something like a valley, it will oscillate out of control and diverge.
  An example of this is shown below.
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/momentum.png' />

<p>
  At this point, it should be clear that several modifications to
  backpropagation need to be made to allow solve this oscillation problem and
  to fix the learning rate issue.
</p>

<h3>Momentum</h3>

<p>
  For this concept, it is useful to think of the progress of the algorithm
  as a point traveling over the cost surface. Momentum in neural
  networks is very much like momentum in physics. And since our 'particle'
  traveling over the cost surface has unit mass, momentum is just the
  velocity of our motion. The equation of backprop with momentum is given by the
  following.

  $$
  \textbf{v}(k) = \lambda \textbf{v}(k-1) - \alpha \nabla J(\textbf{x}, \mathbf{\theta}(k-1))
  $$
  $$
  \mathbf{\theta} (k) = \mathbf{\theta}(k-1) + \textbf{v}(k)
  $$

  The effect of applying this can be seen in the image below. Momentum dampens
  the oscillations and tends to make the trajectory continue in the same
  direction. Values of \( \lambda \) closer to 1 give the trajectory more momentum.
  Keep in mind that \( \lambda \) itself does not actually represent the magnitude
  of the particle's momentum;
  instead, it is more like a force of
  friction for the particle's trajectory. Typical values for \( \lambda \) are 0.5,
  0.9, 0.95 and 0.99.
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/momentum_working.png' />

<p>
  Nesterov momentum is an improvement on the standard momentum algorithm. With
  Nesterov momentum, the gradient of the cost function is considered after the
  momentum has been applied to the network parameters at that iteration. So now
  we have:
  $$
  \textbf{v}(k) = \lambda \textbf{v}(k-1) - \alpha \nabla J(\textbf{x},
  \mathbf{\theta}(k-1) + \lambda \textbf{v}(k-1))
  $$
  $$
  \mathbf{\theta} (k) = \mathbf{\theta}(k-1) + \textbf{v}(k)
  $$
  In general, Nesterov momentum outperforms standard momentum.
</p>

<h3>Adaptive Learning Rates</h3>

<p>
  One of the most difficult hyper-parameters to adjust in neural networks is the
  learning rate. Take a look at the image below to see the effect of learning
  different learning rates on the minimization of the loss function.
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/learningrates.jpeg' />

<p>
  As from above, we know that the trajectory of the algorithm over flat sections
  of the cost surface can be very slow. It would be nice if the
  algorithm could have a fast learning rate over these sections, but a slower
  learning rate over steeper and more sensitive sections. Furthermore, the
  direction of the trajectory is more sensitive in some directions as opposed
  to others. The following algorithms will address all of these issues with
  adaptive learning rates.
</p>

<h3>AdaGrad</h3>

<p>
  The Adaptive Gradient algorithm (AdaGrad) adjusts the learning rate of each
  network parameter according to the history of the gradient with respect to
  that network parameter. This is an inverse relationship, so if a given network
  parameter has had large gradients (i.e. steep slopes) in the recent past, the learning rate will
  scale down significantly.
</p>

<p>
  Whereas before there was just one global learning rate, there is now a per
  parameter learning rate. We set the vector \( \textbf{r} \) to be the
  accumulation of the parameter's past gradients, squared. We initialize this term
  to zero.
  $$
  \textbf{r} = 0
  $$

  Next we compute the gradient as usual
  $$
  \textbf{g} = \frac{1}{Q} \sum_{q=1}^{Q}\nabla J(\textbf{x}_q, \mathbf{\theta}(k-1))
  $$

  And then accumulate this gradient in \( r \) to represent the history of the
  gradient.

  $$
  \textbf{r} = \textbf{r} + \textbf{g}^2
  $$

  And finally, we compute the parameter update
  $$
  \mathbf{\theta} (k) = \mathbf{\theta}(k-1) - \frac{\alpha}{\delta +
  \sqrt{\textbf{r}}}
  \odot g
  $$

  Where \( \alpha \) is the global learning rate, and \( \delta \) is an extremely
  small constant ( \( 10^{-7} \) ). Notice that an element wise vector
  multiplication is being performed (by the \( \odot \) operator). Remember that each element of the gradient
  represents the partial derivative of the function with respect to a given
  parameter. The element wise multiplication will then scale the gradient with
  respect to a given parameter appropriately. The global learning rate is usually not
  difficult to choose, and normally works as just 0.01.
</p>

<p>
  However, a problem with this algorithm is that it considers the whole
  sum of the squared gradient since the <b>beginning</b> of training. In practice,
  This results in
  the learning rate decreasing too much too early.
</p>

<h3>RMSProp</h3>

<p>
  RMSProp is regarded as the go-to optimization algorithm for deep neural
  networks. It is similar to AdaGrad, but includes a decay over the
  accumulation of the past gradient-squared, so the algorithm "forgets" gradients far
  in the past.
</p>

<p>
  As normal, compute the gradient.
  $$
  \textbf{g} = \frac{1}{Q} \sum_{q=1}^{Q}\nabla J(\textbf{x}_q, \mathbf{\theta}(k-1))
  $$

  Now, this is where the algorithm changes with the introduction of the decay
  term \( \rho \), which is set somewhere between 0 and 1.

  $$
  \textbf{r} = \rho \textbf{r} + (1 - \rho) \textbf{g}^2
  $$

  And the parameter update is the same.
  $$
  \mathbf{\theta} (k) = \mathbf{\theta}(k-1) - \frac{\alpha}{\delta +
  \sqrt{\textbf{r}}}
  \odot g
  $$
</p>

<h3>Second Order Algorithms</h3>

<p>
  Second order algorithms make use of the second derivative to "jump" to the
  critical points of the cost function. Further discussion of these algorithms
  is outside the scope of this tutorial. However, these algorithms do not work
  very well in practice. First of all, it is computationally infeasible to
  compute the second order derivatives. Second of all, for a complex
  performance surface with many critical points, it is very likely the second
  order method would go in the completely wrong direction. Overall, gradient
  descent first order methods have been shown to perform
  better, so I would not worry about knowing what second order algorithms are
  all about. But know that they exist and are an active area of research.
</p>

<h2><a name="reg"></a>Regularization (Continued)</h2>

Recall from our previous lesson that regularization is a technique
that we can use to reduce overfitting by producing more robust models
that are more capable of making general predictions in the real world.
In this section, we'll discuss a variety of specific
methods that we can use to address this problem of overfitting.

(If you need a refresher on the general idea behind regularization, 
take a look back at our previous lesson [here](/blog/curriculum/lesson5#reg).)

<h3>\(L^2\) Parameter Regularization</h3>

<p>
Parameter regularization aims to reduce overfitting by penalizing
for overly complex models. We can do this by adding an extra
term to our cost function that penalizes large weights (which usually
indicate overfitting), which helps result in smoother model predictions.

This type of regularization defines the parameter norm penalty as the
following.
$$
\Omega(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \lVert \textbf{w} \rVert_2^2
$$
and the total objective function:
$$
\hat{J}(\theta, \textbf{X}, \textbf{y}) = J(\theta, \textbf{X}, \textbf{y}) +
\frac{\alpha}{2} \textbf{w}^T \textbf{w}
$$  

  Evidently, this regularization will penalize larger weights. In theory, this
should help prevent the model from overfitting. It is common to employ \( L^2
  \) regularization when the number of observations is less than the number of
  features. Similar to \( L^2 \) regularization is \( L^1 \), which you can
  probably expect is just \( \Omega(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \lVert \textbf{w}
  \rVert_1 \). In almost all cases, \( L^2 \) regularization outperforms \( L^1
    \) regularization.
</p>

<h3>Early Stopping</h3>

<p>
When we are working with a dataset, we split that dataset up into testing and
training datasets. The training dataset is used to adjust the weights of the
network. The test dataset is used to check the accuracy of the model on data that
has never been seen before.
</p>

<p>
However, the training dataset can be divided again into the training data and
a small subset of data called the validation set. The validation set is used
during training to ensure that the model is not overfitting. (You can think of the validation
set as lying somewhere between the training set, which is used at every step of the
  training process,
  and the test set, which is only used at the very end of the training process to
  evaluate the model's generalizability.)

  This validation data is not ever used
  to train the model. The validation accuracy refers to the model's accuracy
  over the validation set. The goal is to minimize the validation accuracy
  through tuning hyperparameters of the network. The network is only evaluated
  on the test dataset with the fully tuned model.
  </p>

  <p>
  Take a look at the below graph showing validation loss versus training loss.
  It should be clear that at a certain point, the model overfits on the training
  data and begins to suffer in validation accuracy despite this not being
  reflected in the training accuracy.
  </p>

  <img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/valid_train_loss.png' />

  <p>
  The solution to this is to simply stop training once the validation set loss
  has not improved for some time. Just like \( L^1 \) and \( L^2 \)
  regularization, this is a method of decreasing overfitting on the training
  dataset.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="ensemble"></a>Ensemble Methods</h3>
  <p>
  <i>Bagging</i> (short for bootstrap aggregation, a term in statistics) is the
  technique of making a model generalize better by combining multiple weaker
  learners into a stronger learner. Using this technique, several models are
  trained separately and their results are averaged for the final result. This
  ideal of one model being composed of several independent models is called an
  ensemble method. Ensemble methods are a great way to fine tune your model to
  make it generalize better on test data. Ensemble methods apply to more than
  just neural networks, and can be used on any machine learning technique.
  Almost all machine learning competitions are won using ensemble methods.
  Often times, these ensembles can be comprised of dozens and dozens of
  learners.
  </p>

  <p>
  The idea is that if each model is trained independently of each other, they
  will have their own errors on the test set. However, when the results of the
  ensemble learners are averaged the error should approach zero.
  </p>

  <p>
  Using bagging, we can even train a multiple models on the same dataset but be
  sure that the models were trained independently. With bagging, \( k \)
  different datasets of the same size are constructed from the original dataset
  for \( k \) learners. Each dataset is constructed by sampling from the
  original dataset with some probability with replacement. So there will be
  duplicate and missing values in the constructed dataset.
  </p>

  <p>
  Furthermore, differences in model initialization and hyperparameter tuning
  can make ensembles of neural networks particularly favorable.
  </p>

<h3>Dropout</h3>

<p>
  Dropout is a very useful form of regularization when used on deep neural
  networks. At a high level, dropout can be thought of randomly removing neurons
  from some layer of the network with a probability \( p \). Removing certain
  neurons helps prevent the network from overfitting.
</p>

<p>
  In reality, dropout is a form of ensemble learning. Dropout trains an ensemble
  of networks where various neurons have been removed and then averages the
  results, just as before. Below is an image that may help visualize what
  dropout does to a network.
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/dropout.jpeg' />

<p>
  Dropout can be applied to input units and hidden units. The hyperparameter of
  dropout at a given layer is the probability with which a neuron is dropped.
  Furthermore, another major benefit of dropout is that the computational cost
  of using it is relatively low. Finding the correct probability will require
  parameter tuning because a probability too low and dropout will have no
  effect, while too high and the network will be unable to learn anything.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, dropout makes more robust models and is a standard technique
  employed in deep neural networks.
</p>

<h2><a name="ugp"></a>The Unstable Gradient Problem</h2>

<p>
  As a final section, let's go over a problem in optimization that plagued the
  deep learning community for decades.
</p>

<p>
  As we've seen, deeper neural networks can be a lot more powerful than their
  shallow counterparts. Deeper layers of
  neurons add more layers of abstraction for the network to work with. Deep
  neural networks are vital to visual recognition problems. Modern deep neural
  networks built for visual recognition are hundreds of layers deep.
</p>

  However, you may think that you can take what you have learned so far build a
  very deep neural network and expect it to work. However, to your surprise you
  may see that adding more layers at a certain point does not seem to help and
  even reduces the accuracy. Why is this the case?
</p>

<p>
  The answer is in unstable gradients. This problem plagued deep learning up
  until 2012, and its relatively recent solutions are responsible
  for much of the deep learning boom. The cause
  of the unstable gradient problem can be formulated as different layers in the
  neural network having vastly different learning rates. And this problem only
  gets worse with the more layers that are added. The vanishing gradient
  problem occurs when earlier layers learn slower than later layers. The
  exploding gradient problem is the opposite. Both of these issues deal with
  how the errors are backpropagated through the network.
</p>

<!-- TODO: Change notation, vocab (Use: "error", delta) -->

<p>
  Let's recall the equation for backpropagating the error terms through the network.
  $$
  \delta^{m} =
  f'(\textbf{z}^{m}) \left( \textbf{W}^{m + 1} \right)^{T}
  \delta^{m+1}
  $$

  Now let's say the network has 5 layers. Let's compute the various
  error terms recursively through the network.

  $$
  \delta^5 = \frac{\partial J}{\partial \textbf{z}^5}
  $$

  $$
  \delta^4 = f'(\textbf{z}^4)(\textbf{W}^{5})^T \frac{\partial J}{\partial \textbf{z}^5}
  $$

  $$
  \delta^3 = f'(\textbf{z}^3)(\textbf{W}^{4})^T f'(\textbf{z}^4)(\textbf{W}^{5})^T \frac{\partial J}{\partial \textbf{z}^5}
  $$

  $$
  \delta^2 = f'(\textbf{z}^2)(\textbf{W}^{3})^T f'(\textbf{z}^3)(\textbf{W}^{4})^T f'(\textbf{z}^4)(\textbf{W}^{5})^T \frac{\partial J}{\partial \textbf{z}^5}
  $$

  $$
  \delta^1 = f'(\textbf{z}^1)(\textbf{W}^{2})^T f'(\textbf{z}^2)(\textbf{W}^{3})^T f'(\textbf{z}^3)(\textbf{W}^{4})^T f'(\textbf{z}^4)(\textbf{W}^{5})^T \frac{\partial J}{\partial \textbf{n}^5}
  $$

  The term for \( \delta^1 \) is massive, and this is only for a five layer
  deep network. Imagine what it would be for a 100 layer deep network! The
  important take away is that all of the terms are being multiplied together in a giant chain.

  For a while, the sigmoid function was believed to be a powerful activation
  function. The sigmoid function and its derivative are shown below.

<p>
  Say we were using the sigmoid function for our five layer neural
  network.  That would mean that \( f' \) is the function
  shown in red. What is the maximum value of that function? It's around 0.25.
  What types of values are we starting with for the weights? Small random
  values. The key here is that the values start small. The cause of the vanishing gradient
  problem should now start becoming clear. Because of the chain rule, we are
  recursively multiplying by terms less far less than one, causing the
  error terms to shrink and shrink going backwards in the network.  
</p>

<p>
  With this many multiplication terms, it would be something of a magical balancing act
  to manage all the terms so that the overall expression does not explode or
  shrink significantly.
</p>

<p>
  How do we fix this problem? The answer is actually pretty simple. Just use
  the ReLU activation function instead of the sigmoid activation function. The
  ReLU function and its derivative are shown below.
</p>

<img class='center-image' src='/assets/img/ml/crash_course/relu.png' />

<p>
  As you can see, its derivative is either 0 or 1, which alleviates the unstable
  gradient problem. This function is also much easier to compute.
